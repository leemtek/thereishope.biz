                <p>About Coach Coleman<br><br>

                Coach Coleman is one of this countries foremost resources teaching, mentoring and motivating athletes to become successful on and off the field. Athletes on every level from professional to youth have applied Coach Coleman’s teaching techniques and philosophies to become elite performers on every level. After spending time in what he terms “the laboratory” athletes improve technique, athletic intelligence, and emotional resilience.<br><br>

                For several decades Coach Coleman has taught from a simple mantra “every day and every way, we get a little better”. Using his 5-tier Championship approach that is both practical and enlightening for athletes to pursue the Champion within.<br><br>

                As a passionate believer in the “possibility of the impossible”, Coach Coleman teaches with passion, humor, and hope that are infectious to everyone witnessing his performance. He continuously exhorts clients that their best performance is still ahead of them so one must pursue relentlessly.<br><br>

                He is a native of Southern California through his formative years, later graduating from high school in the Bay Area (Oakland, CA). Coach Coleman grew up as an under-size athlete with an “over size desire” and strong faith. With the grace of God he used these attributes to propel him to obtain a Division I athletic-scholarship. As a Division I athlete he was awarded all league, honorable mention all-American awards, later becoming a Free Agent wide receiver with the Oakland Raiders. Although injuries cut short his professional career, he discovered a unique skill set for teaching, coaching and motivating others. He formulated, organized, and implemented those processes, which are currently used to teach others how to achieve championship results on the playing field and in life.<br><br>

                Coach Coleman began his coaching at Sacramento State University and quickly fell under the watchful eye of Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh. It was under Walsh that he studied as a coaching intern and learned many of the principles he draws from today. One of Coach Coleman’s applicable take-away ideologies while working with the San Francisco 49ers was to become a master craft-man at whatever you’re attempting. To acquire the mastery necessary for excellence requires a carefully crafted plan and method of approach.<br><br>

                The 5-tier approach to becoming a champion at whatever you desire, plus resources gleamed from the 49ers, and over 20 years studying his craft has made Coach Coleman a sought after resource to produce life changing results. If you are a player, team, or an organization desiring to learn championship principles of success, it is a must that you spend time with Coach Coleman in “the lab”!</p><br>
